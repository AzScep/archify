## Live Archify installations

Install, update, reinstall, or remove a live Archify installation only when the user explicitly requests that action. Repository editing, testing, reviewing, publishing, or syncing does not authorize installation. This applies to Skills CLI, manual ZIP copies, and DSH plugins. Reuse authorization already given for the same action and scope; ask only for unresolved decisions.

- Keep the source, Skill/package, target agents, and global/project scope within the request. Avoid bulk operations or force flags that expand that scope. An update notification is informational.
- Before a Skills CLI install, run `npx -y skills add tt-a1i/archify --list --full-depth` and verify exactly one Skill named `archify`. Stop on failed or ambiguous discovery.
- Use the canonical remote source by default. Use a local source only when requested, from a durable checkout; live symlinks must not point into temporary directories or disposable worktrees.
- Preserve unrelated files and existing unmanaged destinations. Report a destination conflict before replacing it unless that exact replacement is already explicitly authorized; use the installer's documented conflict handling within the approved scope.
- Report the action, source, targets, and result, including skipped or failed destinations. A partial installation is not a complete success.
